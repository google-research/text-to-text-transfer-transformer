This directory contains configurations for unsupervised training objectives.

Naming conventions:

Most files follow the following naming scheme:

<noise-pattern>_<noise-density-percentage>_<inputs-encoding>_<targets-encoding>

<noise-pattern>:
   iid: positions are chosen independently to be noise/non-noise
   span_<n>: random spans are chosen to be noise.  The average length of a noise
     span is n tokens.
   reg_<n>: regular pattern of spans of n noise tokens interspersed with the
      number of non-noise tokens necessary to reach the desired noise-density.
   reg_<min-n>-<max-n>: same as above, but for each sequence we first pick n
      randomly within the given bounds

<noise-density-percentage>:
   a two-digit number indicating what percentage of tokens should be noise'

<inputs-encoding>:
   m: (mask) - replace each noise token with the same sentinel
   r: replace each noise token with a random token from the vocab
   g: replace each noise token with a random token gathered from the sequence
   p: randomly permute all noise tokens within the sequence
   d: drop noise tokens
   s: replace each span of consecutive noise tokens with the same sentinel.
   u: replace each span of consecutive noise tokens with a different sentinel.

<targets-encoding>:
   f: full original sequence
   d: drop non-noise tokens
   s: replace each span of consecutive non-noise tokens with the same sentinel.
   u: replace each span of consecutive non-noise tokens with a different
      sentinel (aligned with the sentinels used in the inputs)
