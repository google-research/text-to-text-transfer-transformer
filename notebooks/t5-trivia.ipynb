        "\n",
        "*The following tutorial guides you through the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained T5 model, evaluating its accuracy, and using it for prediction,\n",
        "all on a free Google Cloud TPU \u003ca href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/master/notebooks/t5-trivia.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "T5 was introduced in the paper [_Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683). In that paper, we provided a comprehensive picture of how we pre-trained a standard text-to-text Transformer model on a large text corpus, achieving state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks after fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We pre-trained T5 on a mixture of supervised and unsupervised tasks with the majoriy of data coming from an unlabeled dataset we developed called [C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4). C4 is based on a massive scrape of the web produced by [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org). Loosely speaking, pre-training on C4 ideally gives T5 an understanding of natural language in addition to general world knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How can we assess what T5 knows?\n",
        "\n",
        "As the name implies, T5 is a text-to-text model, which enables us to train it on arbitrary tasks involving a textual input and output. As we showed in our paper, a huge variety of NLP tasks can be cast in this format, including translation, summarization, and even classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to use this text-to-text framework is on reading comprehension problems, where the model is fed some context along with a question and is trained to predict the question's answer. For example, we might feed the model the text from the Wikipedia article about [Hurrican Connie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Connie) along with the question \"On what date did Hurricane Connie occur?\" and train the model to predict the answer \"August 3rd, 1955\".\n",
        "A related task is open-domain question answering (QA) where the model is not provided with this oracle context. Typically, open-domain QA systems include a mechanism to look up information in an external knowledge source. This setting is similar to an \"open-book\" exam.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll be training T5 on a variant of this task which we call **closed-book question answering**. In closed-book QA, we feed the model a question *without any context or access to external knowledge* and train it to predict the answer. Since the model doesn't receive any context, the primary way it can learn to answer these questions is based on the \"knowledge\" it obtained during pre-training. We don't expect T5 to contain super specific information, so we will be focusing on two question-answering datasets which largely include trivia questions (i.e. facts about well-known subjects). [Similar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066) [investigations](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) have recently been done to test the knowledge stored by BERT and GPT-2.\n",
        "\n",
        "T5 was not pre-trained on closed-book QA, so in this notebook we'll first create two new tasks and then use the [`t5`](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) library to fine-tune, evaluate, and obtain predictions from T5. In the end, T5's performance on closed-book QA can give us a sense of what kind (and how much) information T5 managed to learn during pre-training.\n",
        "\n",
        "## State-of-the-art Results\n",
        "We published a [more in-depth investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910) of closed-book QA with T5 where we achieved SOTA on open-domain variants of WebQuestions and TriviaQA in addition to surpisingly strong results on Natural Questions. The code in this notebook is a simplified version of those experiments but still produces good results.\n",
        "\n",
        "For code to reproduce our best results, please see the [t5_closed_book_qa](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/t5_closed_book_qa) repo.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Caveats\n",
        "\n",
        "* While we provide instructions for running on a [Cloud TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) via Colab for free, a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](http://console.cloud.google.com/storage) bucket is required for storing model parameters and data. The [GCS free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) provides 5 GB of storage, which should be enough to train the `large` model and smaller but not the `3B` or `11B` parameter models. You can use part of your initial $300 credit to get more space.\n",
        "* The Cloud TPU provided by Colab (a `v2-8`) does not have enough memory to fine-tune the `11B` parameter model. For this model, you will need to fine-tune inside of a GCP instance (see [README](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/)).\n",
